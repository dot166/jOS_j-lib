<!-- A few notes about maintaining this file:

     The sorting in the file is as follows:
      - The MCC codes in the network field are sorted in ascending order, if the
        country has multiple MCC codes, or has territories with different MCC codes
      - The sensitivePN entries are sorted in ascending order by the first MCC code
      - The phone numbers in a sensitivePN entry are grouped in increasing lengths,
        and within the various lengths they are sorted in ascending order.

     When adding a new country, please keep the following in mind:
      - Whether the country has multiple MCC codes.
      - Whether the country has any territories with different MCC codes.
      - What the most recognizable name for the country is, left as a comment.

     When adding a new phone number, please keep the following in mind:
      - Whether there are multiple forms of the phone number (long and short).
      - Whether the number is valid for all territories of the country.

     Due to differences in local laws, please do not add any numbers for:
      - Police (excludes anonymous tip hotlines)
      - Fire department
      - Medical emergency
      - Poisoning helplines
      - Food safety hotlines

     The list below is incomplete by design. Feel free to add not just the general
     numbers, but also the contact numbers for the organizations behind the helplines.
     Types of numbers, hotlines and helplines that should be added:
      - Alcoholics Anonymous numbers
      - Domestic violence helplines
      - Emotional support helplines
      - Human trafficking hotlines
      - Legal aid helplines
      - Mental health helplines
      - Missing children hotlines
      - Narcotics Anonymous numbers
      - Numbers for anonymous crime reporting
      - Numbers for shelters for victims of abuse
      - Psychological support
      - Rehab centers' contact numbers
      - Sexual assault helplines
      - Sexuality / gender identity helplines
